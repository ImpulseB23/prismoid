//! Sidecar supervisor: owns the full lifecycle of the Go sidecar child
//! process. Spawns it, wires up the shared-memory ring, forwards stdout/stderr
//! to tracing, and respawns on termination with exponential backoff.
//!
//! The supervisor runs as a single long-lived tokio task kicked off from
//! `lib::setup`. Each iteration creates a fresh mapping + event pair
//! (handles are single-use by design, since the child closes them on exit)
//! and tears them down when the child dies. Emits `sidecar_status` events
//! on every state transition so the frontend can react without a second
//! refactor when UI chrome lands.
//!
//! Non-Windows targets are not supported yet; the supervisor is gated
//! behind `cfg(windows)` and callers fall back to a warn-and-bail in
//! `lib::setup`.
